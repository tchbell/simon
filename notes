What I want to accomplish

When start is clicked simon picks a random color and highlights it. That cell is stored in an array so that the player can match the arrary contents later.

Start button is clicked. Round number is increased by 1. 1 is passed into a funciton so it is only called once as many times as the round is

computer makes random numbers selected to highlight each box;

starts at 1 per round and increases once every round;
